this website is there for anyone who needs to have a way of tracking their time slots and then making sure that it is up-to-date and looks stylish and clean.

it has a section where the admin and staff can put in the news from that week like for example a local painter wants to do a master class and people can book in with them and how much it will cost 


the home page is the hub for a bit of all of the news and the way to log in or register for the site which once registered allows them to book slots in the shop.

    - I'll show you in the main app urls.py I added the following!
    - in settings.py I added to line 135
    - and I removed the static lines from booking > urls.py 
- Found that when I was trying to input my date and time on the booking form I was struggling to find the right way of getting it to show on the form fixed by using date and time input types for it.
- struggling to get the form to post to the database
    - the submit button did not work
    - submit button but it gave me back a 405 error
