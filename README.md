## Features
this website is there for anyone who needs to have a way of tracking their time slots and then making sure that it is up-to-date and looks stylish and clean.

it has a section where the admin and staff can put in the news from that week like for example a local painter wants to do a master class and people can book in with them and how much it will cost 


the home page is the hub for a bit of all of the news and the way to log in or register for the site which once registered allows them to book slots in the shop.

    - the submit button did not work
    - submit button but it gave me back a 405 error
